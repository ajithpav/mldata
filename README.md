# Dataclening and Data visvaloisation

## Description
This project utilizes data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to process and analyze datasets. The code leverages libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Imbalanced-learn (imblearn) for handling imbalanced datasets, visualization, and data manipulation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Seaborn**: Used for statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting graphs and charts.
- **Imbalanced-learn (imblearn)**: Used for handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Pickle**: Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib imbalanced-learn
```

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import imblearn
   from matplotlib import pyplot
   import pickle
   ```
2. Load and manipulate datasets using Pandas:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   print(df.head())
   ```
3. Perform data visualization:
   ```python
   sns.histplot(df['column_name'])
   plt.show()
   ```
4. Handle imbalanced datasets with Imbalanced-learn:
   ```python
   from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
   smote = SMOTE()
   X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
   ```
5. Save and load models using Pickle:
   ```python
   with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
       pickle.dump(model, f)
   ```
   ```python
   with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       loaded_model = pickle.load(f)
   ```
